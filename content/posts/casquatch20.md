I'm very excited to announce the 2.0 release of Casquatch! With it comes a full rewrite to align with the 4.x DataStax OSS Driver, new manual (https://tmobile.github.io/casquatch), annotations, spring integration, failover policy, and even more streamlined code.

Get yourself a cup of coffee and run through the tutorial (https://tmobile.github.io/casquatch/examples/springrest/). You'll be up and running with a full Spring Rest DAO in just a few minutes.
