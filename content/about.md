Hello! My name is Josh Turner. I've been in the technology field for a little over a decade now. I've worked across the spectrum from code monkey just developing what the Business Analyst asked for to leading teams. I've lead strategy, defined goals, and worked with leadership to move the business forward. I've built databases, applications, infrastructure, distributed systems, and contributed to open source projects. I've been in operations and fought outages at 3 AM to then explain to leadership what happened at 9 AM. I've advocated for my customers at every level as they are why we are here. I love working with technology and exploring new ideas. I also love automating it all so I never have to do it again. I like to say that if I've automated myself out of a job then I've succeeded.

Currently the following technologies are what I'm focused and playing with (but the list is likely already out of date):

- Java
- Cassandra
- Oracle
- Ansible
- Kafka
- ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)

## TDL / The Digital Link
The Digital Link (TDL) is a website name I purchased back when I was a kid and have used it for various items over the years. I've paired it with old StarCraft style usernames to create tdl-jturner which I use on the various platforms. This page is a place to give me a home to tie back to. I've also started putting blog entries of projects I'm working on and find of interest.

## Speaking
I'm always interested in speaking opportunities, especially in the Greater Seattle Area. If you would like to discuss any meetups or conferences please just shoot me an email at [turner.josh@gmail.com](mailto:turner.josh@gmail.com).

## Resume
[LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/turnerjosh) is the best place to see what I am up to professionally. An actual concise Resume is available upon request, just shoot me an email at [turner.josh@gmail.com](mailto:turner.josh@gmail.com) and we can talk.
