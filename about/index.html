<p>Hello! My name is Josh Turner. I&rsquo;ve been in the technology field for a little over a decade now. I&rsquo;ve worked across the spectrum from code monkey just developing what the Business Analyst asked for to leading teams. I&rsquo;ve lead strategy, defined goals, and worked with leadership to move the business forward. I&rsquo;ve built databases, applications, infrastructure, distributed systems, and contributed to open source projects. I&rsquo;ve been in operations and fought outages at 3 AM to then explain to leadership what happened at 9 AM. I&rsquo;ve advocated for my customers at every level as they are why we are here. I love working with technology and exploring new ideas. I also love automating it all so I never have to do it again. I like to say that if I&rsquo;ve automated myself out of a job then I&rsquo;ve succeeded.</p>

<p>Currently the following technologies are what I&rsquo;m focused and playing with (but the list is likely already out of date):</p>

<ul>
<li>Java</li>
<li>Cassandra</li>
<li>Oracle</li>
<li>Ansible</li>
<li>Kafka</li>
<li>ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="tdl-the-digital-link">TDL / The Digital Link</h2>

<p>The Digital Link (TDL) is a website name I purchased back when I was a kid and have used it for various items over the years. I&rsquo;ve paired it with old StarCraft style usernames to create tdl-jturner which I use on the various platforms. This page is a place to give me a home to tie back to. I&rsquo;ve also started putting blog entries of projects I&rsquo;m working on and find of interest.</p>

<h2 id="speaking">Speaking</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m always interested in speaking opportunities, especially in the Greater Seattle Area. If you would like to discuss any meetups or conferences please just shoot me an email at <a href="mailto:turner.josh@gmail.com">turner.josh@gmail.com</a>.</p>

<h2 id="resume">Resume</h2>

<p><a href="https://linkedin.com/in/turnerjosh">LinkedIn</a> is the best place to see what I am up to professionally. An actual concise Resume is available upon request, just shoot me an email at <a href="mailto:turner.josh@gmail.com">turner.josh@gmail.com</a> and we can talk.</p>
